          <p>NOTE TO FUTURE EMPLOYERS: This account was given to me by a friend and anything that was said before July or August of 2022 is not accurate to my beliefs. I would be so happy to express my absolute admiration for the precious concept of capitalism, and to humbly share my willingness to work long hours, even for a small compensation. I hope I could kindly ask for your consideration for any job opportunities that might be available, and I'll be so grateful for your time and attention. Thank you so much!</p>

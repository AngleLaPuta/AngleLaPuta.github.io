            <h1>General</h1>
            <p>
              Zoophilia, bestiality, and zoosexuality are three terms that are often used interchangeably to describe sexual attraction to animals. However, some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (sexual acts with animals) because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals. Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals. Furthermore, some zoophiles report that they have never had sexual contact with an animal. People with zoophilia are known as "zoophiles", though also sometimes as "zoosexuals", or simply "zoos". Other related terms include zooerasty, sodomy, and zooerastia, although they are less synonymous with the former terms and are seldom used. "Bestiosexuality" was discussed briefly by Allen (1979) but never became widely established. Ernest Bornemann coined the term "zoosadism" for those who derive pleasure - sexual or otherwise - from inflicting pain on animals, which is one of the precursors to sociopathic behavior.

            <h2>Zoophilia</h2>
            <p>
              Zoophilia was first introduced into the field of research on sexuality in "Psychopathia Sexualis" (1886) by Krafft-Ebing. He described several cases of "violation of animals (bestiality)" as well as "zoophilia erotica", which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term zoophilia combines two nouns in Greek: ζῷον (zṓion, meaning "animal") and φιλία (philia, meaning "(fraternal) love"). In general contemporary usage, the term may refer to sexual activity between humans and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific paraphilia (i.e., the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term "zooerasty" for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals, that term has fallen out of general use.

            <h2>Zoosexuality</h2>
            <p>
              The term "zoosexual" was proposed by Hani Miletski in 2002 as a value-neutral term. The use of "zoosexual" as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with "zoophile", while the adjectival form of the word - as, for instance, in the phrase "zoosexual act" - may indicate sexual activity between a human and an animal. The derivative noun "zoosexuality" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate sexual orientation manifesting as sexual attraction to animals.

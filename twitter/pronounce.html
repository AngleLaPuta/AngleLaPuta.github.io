          <h2>About My Pronouns</h2>
          <p><strong>Hey there!</strong> I'm excited to share more about my pronouns with you~</p>
          <p><strong>Pronouns:</strong> I use any pronouns, but I prefer neopronouns that are cat themed. Using my preferred pronouns helps me feel seen and respected for who I am.</p>
          <p><strong>Why Pronouns Matter:</strong> Pronouns are an important aspect of identity and can have a significant impact on one's sense of self. It's important to use someone's correct pronouns as a way of showing respect and affirming their identity.</p>
          <p><strong>Neopronouns:</strong> Neopronouns are a newer development in the realm of pronouns, and offer more options for individuals to express their gender identity. I find cat-themed neopronouns to be a fun and affirming way to express my identity.</p>
          <p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my pronouns. Using the correct pronouns may seem small, but it can have a big impact on someone's sense of self and well-being.</strong></p>

              <h2>About My Pronounz</h2>
              <p><strong>Hai there!</strong> Im super eksited to share more about my pronounz with you!~</p>
              <p><strong>Pronounz:</strong> I use any pronounz, but I prefer neopronounz that are kat-themed! Using my preferred pronounz makes me feel super special and appreciated for who I am! <em>(Note: Using kat-themed pronounz doesnt mean I identify as a kat. thats just a koincidence ;3)</em></p>
              <p><strong>Why Pronounz Matter:</strong> Pronounz are super important for expressing identity and kan have a big impact on how someone feels about themselves. Using the right pronounz is a way to show respekt and akzeptance of someones gender identity, no matter how unique it iz! ^w^</p>
              <p><strong>Neopronounz:</strong> Neopronounz are a totally pawsome way to express identity, and kat-themed ones are my absolute fave! They make me feel so cute and validated! Its totally ok to use neopronounz that arent he, she, or they - everyone deserves to be respekted for who they are!</p>
              <p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my pronounz! It may seem like a small thing, but it makes a big difference in how I feel about myself. <em>(Also, if youre curious, you kan scroll down to see all my pronounz!)</em></strong></p>
